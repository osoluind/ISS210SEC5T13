                <div class="container"><p>Countless women in the corporate world are suffering the cut of their paycheck while men are thriving off of unequal pay and more at the expense of these women. Gender inequality in the workplace is a large and rising issue in our society today. According to Pew Center Research, 42% of women in the workforce have experienced a wide variety of discrimination at work, including microaggressions, earning less wages, feeling ostracized or isolated, having worse treatment than their male counterparts, and more. We consistently see men getting promoted into higher roles as women are again and again denied these same roles. It isn’t because of some lack of competence that all women seemingly possess, it is because of discrimination and unconscious or conscious gender bias against women in the workplace. While it’s easy to say that this shouldn't be the case in our growing and diverse society, realistically, it is the case. Gender-bias discrimination isn't only evident in pay but is also shown through non-verbal actions, bonuses, promotions, security in jobs, and bias in group work. In the USA, the workforce is about 52.7% men and 47.2% women (Andrade). Similarly, women have an approximately 18.5% wage gap for full-time workers compared to men who are employed the same (Andrade). In our day and age, women deserve to be seen, not just because they are women, but because their degrees make them equally qualified for these roles that are being passed over to men who may not be. Equal opportunity is not a privilege, but a right that all women are entitled to regardless of gender.
Moreover, 60% of women in Quebec, Canada work in the same four fields: retail, education, health care, and social assistance (Genin). When there are little to few options it doesn’t give very much occupational freedom that men have. They don’t have the same financial opportunities presented to them with equal representation. Therefore, this leaves thousands of different jobs in Quebec left to be run by men. Without differentiation in gender in occupations, we lack more than 20% of diversity. It has been proved that without gender diversity, men may be less likely to promote new innovation and services, and instead, focus on the ideation process (Andrade). 	
When talking about diversity in the workplace, it’s clear to see that it is more beneficial than having one, specific group of people. For instance, increased creativity, revenue, and productivity are all products of a diverse environment. Gender diversity brings in a larger scope of skills than if it were just one gender. Maybe the most important benefit is that gender equality yields “better results” (Andrade). Thus, it’s a very important goal to work towards in the workplace. Some ways to increase women's positions in the workforce are verifying that processes for hiring people are free of gender biases. 
When having an open mind to all genders it can benefit a corporation in more ways than one. A company can gain by being inclusive of people of all genders in a variety of ways. With the correct representation, it can be a place for both men and women. Additionally, when everyone is given the same rights and representation, the economy may also benefit. It is important to strive toward establishing specific goals that raise the proportion of women in leadership roles, requiring diversity training in the workplace, and fostering an inclusive atmosphere in businesses. But in order to make much progress, these techniques must be continued.

The desk is tilted, indicating that she is not receiving the same benefits as a male doing the same job. She is not getting paid nearly as much as the man is, and this goes to show the gender inequality women face every day in the workplace, this example being with the gender pay gap. This gender pay gap is quite normal in society with women and men in the same line of work.

                                    <p class="mb-4">This video talks about gender inequality in the workplace and its various causes. Even though adding gender diversity to a workplace helps overall success, women still aren’t in certain positions to help them succeed. According to the video, workplaces tend to promote a specific type of worker who are usually “white, middle class, able bodied, heterosexual men.” The problem with this is that the majority of people don’t fit this description. And in today’s society, the more differences a person has, the more barriers and difficulties they will face, as opposed to white, heterosexual men, especially in the workplace. Women experience these challenges the moment that they enter workplaces. Finding ways to let men and women show up to the workplace and collaborate together in spite of their differences is critical to promoting gender equality and subsequently, success. </p>

The desk is tilted, indicating that she is not receiving the same benefits as a male doing the same job. She is not getting paid nearly as much as the man is, and this goes to show the gender inequality women face every day in the workplace, this example being with the gender pay gap. This gender pay gap is quite normal in society with women and men in the same line of work.

They highlight that women only earn approximately 80% of a man’s earnings, which is even lower for women of color. Their solution to these injustices include empowering women to solve these problems together by hosting a variety of events; each of which are situated in different states such as Colorado, Georgia, and Wisconsin. You can contact them via their website: https://9to5.org/getinvolved/ as well as contribute donations to help them reach their goal of $70,000.

                                    <p class="mb-4">This sketch at first sight seems like a fair depiction of equality between men and women, due to them all starting at the same starting line. However, in the women’s lane are household appliances and chores. These things are common stereotypes for women, that they are the caretakers and housewives of society: they’re expected to cook, wash and iron clothes, and clean only. These pressures are often carried over into the workplace, evident through unfair advantages given to women as well as inequalities against them in general. This graphic ultimately shows that women don’t have a fair chance in the workplace against their male counterparts. Them starting at the same line as the men give the semblance that all is well, but that is not the case. Women must jump through hurdles to gain the same level of respect and pay as men, all due to their gender. This bias in the workplace is harmful to women as it perpetuates stereotypes associated with them. According to a study by Charles W. Mueller in the “Interactional Processes and Gender Workplace Inequalities” (Mueller), it states that "interactional mechanisms are sufficient in themselves to create gender inequality in pay and power among participants and to generate sex-typing of work.” Sex-typing is very evident in this graphic. Gender diversity is, and will always be a good thing in the workplace due to its unending benefits. Once people put away their biases, everybody can begin to benefit.

                                    <p class="mb-4">This picture represents gender inequality in a workplace. Women often have to fight harder than men to earn their place in work settings. This picture demonstrates a woman (alone) who is struggling to pull the rope against 3 men. To go deeper in context, women have less opportunities for leadership roles, equal pay as men, and lack of flexible work hours. According to Martin Halliday’s article, “Did We Miss the Point on Gender Inequality in the Workplace?” He states that “women are disproportionately represented in certain jobs, and that women are overlooked for promotion compared to their male counterparts” (Halliday). </p>
